# LogBot

# It's a discord bot that collects messages, photos, and gifs (it may log the file or the tenor link). It will log what users send in servers.
# If the user deletes any of their messages in discord, their message is still able to be seen in the logs of bot.

# In later versions it will log Video, Audio, and other files
